## About
This repository contains the code and other resources used for the second programming assignment, Vigenere Cipher. The Python code will read either a plaintext or ciphertext from stdin and send the generated output file to stdout. The mode (-e to encrypt or -d to decrypt) and the key must be provided via the command line for the code to work properly.
